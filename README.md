## How it Works

FlashMaster turns any Google Sheet into a powerful study app. You create the data, and FlashMaster provides the interface to study it.

### Step 1: Create Your Flashcards
1.  Create a new **Google Sheet**.
2.  In the first row, add two headers: `Question` and `Answer`.
3.  Fill in your rows with the content you want to learn.
    *   *Column A (Question):* The front of the card / the prompt.
    *   *Column B (Answer):* The back of the card / the solution.

### Step 2: Publish Your Sheet
1.  In your Google Sheet, go to **File > Share > Publish to web**.
2.  Click **Publish**.
3.  Copy the link provided (or just copy your browser's URL bar link).

### Step 3: Start Studying
1.  Open **[FlashMaster](https://aruneshmishra.github.io/flash-master/)**.
2.  Paste your Google Sheet link into the box.
3.  Click **Load Deck**.
